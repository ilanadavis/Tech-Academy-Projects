/*
 * (2) In the Web Forms project, you will create a Game class that contains the 
logic for a simple game of darts.  Two players will take turns throwing three
darts per turn.  Their respective scores accumulate after each turn by adding 
the score from each dart to the Player's score.  

The first Player to reach 300 points wins.  

If the dart lands in the double or triple band, multiply the score by 2x or 3x, respectively.  

Display the winner and both player's scores on the web page.
